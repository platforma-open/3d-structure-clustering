Stage PDBs under synthetic FoldSeek-safe filenames instead of the raw clonotypeKey. FoldSeek does not echo arbitrary filename stems back verbatim, which broke the member→clonotypeKey round-trip in process_results.py for certain datasets ("FoldSeek output references unknown member files"). The clonotypeKey↔filename mapping is now carried solely through the manifest.
